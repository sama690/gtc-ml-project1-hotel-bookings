# GTC ML Project 1 – Hotel Booking Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## Project Overview

This project focuses on preparing raw hotel booking data for predictive modeling. The goal is not to train a model, but to design a clean, structured dataset that maximizes the accuracy and reliability of any future machine learning pipeline.  

Last-minute booking cancellations significantly affect hotel revenue. By carefully cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, we aim to support the revenue team in building models that can predict cancellations, allowing proactive management and improved profitability.

## Dataset

The raw data comes from the hotel’s **Property Management System (PMS)**:

- File: `hotel_bookings.csv`
- Contains booking information, customer demographics, stay details, and reservation status.
- Includes both categorical and numerical fields, with some missing values and potential outliers.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Quality Assessment

1. Initial Data Inspection:
   - Load the dataset and examine summary statistics (.info(), .describe()).
   - Identify data types, column distributions, and potential anomalies.

2. Missing Values Analysis:
   - Detect columns with missing values.
   - Visualize missing data patterns using heatmaps or missingness matrices.
   - Assess the impact of missing values on downstream analysis.

3. Outlier Detection:
   - Focus on key numerical fields like adr and lead_time.
   - Use boxplots and Interquartile Range (IQR) methods to identify extreme values.

4. Documentation:
   - Record main data quality issues.
   - Highlight patterns, inconsistencies, and potential risks for model building.

### Phase 2: Data Cleaning

1. Handling Missing Values:
   - Company & Agent: Replace missing entries with "None" or 0.
   - Country: Impute missing values using the mode or assign "Unknown".
   - Children: Fill missing entries with median or mode values where appropriate.

2. Duplicate Removal:
   - Identify and remove exact duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

3. Outlier Management:
   - Cap extreme numerical values (e.g., any adr above 1000 set to 1000) to reduce skew in future models.

4. Data Type Corrections:
   - Ensure all date and numerical columns are properly formatted for analysis.

### Phase 3: Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

1. Derived Features:
   - total_guests = adults + children + babies
   - total_nights = stays_in_weekend_nights + stays_in_week_nights
   - is_family = Binary flag (Yes/No) indicating if the booking includes children or babies

2. Encoding Categorical Variables:
   - Low-cardinality features (e.g., meal, market_segment): One-hot encoding
   - High-cardinality features (e.g., country): Frequency encoding or group rare categories into "Other"

3. Prevent Data Leakage:
   - Drop columns like reservation_status and reservation_status_date that contain information unavailable at the time of prediction.

4. Final Dataset Preparation:
   - Split the cleaned data into training and test sets (test_size=0.2, random_state=42).

## Outcome

By the end of this project, the raw hotel booking data is transformed into a robust, machine-learning-ready dataset, free of duplicates, missing values, and critical outliers. The dataset is now suitable for predictive modeling, ensuring future models are accurate, reliable, and generalizable.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, missingno
- Machine Learning Preprocessing: scikit-learn

## Notes

- The focus of this project is data quality and preprocessing; no predictive modeling is performed.
- Decisions regarding missing values, outliers, and encoding are documented and justified to maintain reproducibility and clarity.
